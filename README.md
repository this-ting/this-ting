# Hi, I'm Ting 👋

**Business brain. Developer hands. Remote-first mindset.**

I turn ideas into products that scale. 3+ years building web applications that serve 500K+ users while driving 177% growth.

## Quick Stats
- 🏆 **$35K hackathon winner** (2nd place, 750 projects)
- 📈 **177% user growth** through React optimization
- 🌍 **500K+ users served** across 10+ timezones
- 🚀 **MVP to production** in 4 weeks

## What I Build
**React, Next.js, TypeScript** | Performance optimization | User-focused products

Currently working on: Automation flows to save time and eliminate manual work
## The Story
**Business → Self-taught developer → Product builder**

I didn't start as a traditional developer. **Bachelor of Commerce** (Marketing, Economics, Psychology) turned into frontend expertise. I speak both languages—technical and business.

**What this means:** I build features that move metrics, not just pretty interfaces.

**Cross-cultural edge:** Canada + Taiwan background = effective communication across diverse remote teams and global audiences.

**Beyond code:** Leading cycling tours, creating content, automation workflows. Project management and systematic problem-solving translate directly to better development work.

## My Approach
- **Product-focused:** Solve user problems, not just write code
- **Performance-obsessed:** Every millisecond matters
- **Communication-driven:** Technical solutions mean nothing if they can't be explained
- **Growth-minded:** Always learning, measuring, improving
